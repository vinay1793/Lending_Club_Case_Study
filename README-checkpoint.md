## General Information
-The borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders, reduces lender’s cash flow. Identifying those risky applicants helps in cutting down the amount of credit loss to the organization. 




## Conclusions
- If loan amount is less, then we should try to cap the loan term to 36 month
- If loan amount is high, we should have a combination higher tenure with medium interest rate.In long term, it will help in recovery of larger amount for investor
- For customer with long employment tenure, following factor need to taken into consideration
     - we need to check DTI value (to see whether existing financial burden is there).
     - Make sure that proper verification and risk analysis is done and no Complacency is done due to tenure
     - Even for longer-tenured employees, apply stricter underwriting standards for larger loan amounts. Don't assume that employment tenure alone guarantees low risk.
     - Use a combination capped loan amount (based on DTI, income and other factor) with high interest- short tenure, or low/medium interest with high tenure.
       
- Verify the payoff of existing debts for debt consolidation loans to ensure responsible use of funds.
